# aurora-hive
have access to your auroracoin hive wallet ([hive.auroracoin.is](hive.auroracoin.is)) from your menubar

The simplest way to access your AUR wallet at any time on your desktop computer. Currently working on OSX/macOS but you should be perfectly fine with building it for windows or linux too. Please let me know of any [issues]() or success!

###ROADMAP
